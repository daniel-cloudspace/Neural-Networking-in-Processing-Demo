Simple Perceptron written in Processing
=======================================

The function we were trying to train on was that of a Bro's decision making process about the hotness of a girl while at a party.

Inputs
------
Input 0: Boob size

Input 1: Weight

Input 2: Skin Tone

Input 3: Bro's B.A.C.

Input 4: Hair Length

Input 5: Badonkadocity



Each input is boolean - either Acceptable (1) or Unacceptable (0), depending on the Bro's personal preference. Each of these attributes could be replaced with a specialized neural network.
